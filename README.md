# My Awesome Project
Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Netlify functions

 I started with looking at the NASA APIs and choosing the Mars Rover Photo API for this project. My grandfather always loved documentries on space and would have loved to see live photos from Mars and thats why I chose it. I hid my API keys with environment variables and served them to the front end with Netlify functions. The poor style choice is a throw back too the Zone on YTV from when I was a kid.

## Optimizations

Might buid out a back end with node to do the API calls and serve the data to the front end instead of using Netlify.

## Lessons Learned:

Learned the woa's of hosting a site and hiding the environment variable in a backend.
